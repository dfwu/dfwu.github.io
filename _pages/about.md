I am a fifth-year graduate student in the Linguistics Department at MIT. My primary interests are in syntax. I have worked on the English disjunction coordinators *either* and *whether*, ellipsis, and expletives *there* and *it*. Recently I branched out into prosody, and studied the phonetics of focus prosody in English and Zulu using experimental methods.

I think theoretical linguistics should connect and interact with fields that explore the same questions using different methods, such as experimental linguistics and computational linguistics. I also think that linguistics is ultimately a part of cognitive science, and hope that all the proposals I make about human language are cognitively realistic, learnable and evolvable.

In an effort to bridge MIT Linguistics, Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and Computer Science, I co-organized [CompLang](https://complang.mit.edu/), a weekly discussion group among the three departments that touch on high-level questions like what scientific questions are central to our study, and [what kinds of evidence are considered the most important](http://lingphil.mit.edu/papers/dfwu/Knowledge of language and how it is put into use.pdf). I also co-organized a linguistics [course](https://dfwu.wordpress.com/2019/09/14/69/) for cognitive scientists and computer scientists at MIT in Fall 2019.
