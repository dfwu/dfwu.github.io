I am a fifth-year graduate student in the Linguistics Department at MIT. My primary interests are in syntax and prosody. I have worked on the syntax of coordinators *either*, *whether* and *but*, ellipsis, and expletives *there* and *it*. I have also studied the prosody of focus in English and Zulu using experimental methods. Recently I have been thinking about the prosody of ellipsis, and wondering if we could find prosodic cues indicating the presence of elided material in the underlying structure.

I think theoretical linguistics should connect and interact with fields that explore the same questions using different methods, such as experimental linguistics and computational linguistics. I also think that linguistics is ultimately a part of cognitive science, and hope that all the proposals I make about human language are cognitively realistic, learnable and evolvable.

In an effort to bridge MIT Linguistics, Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and Computer Science, I co-organized [CompLang][1], a weekly discussion group among the three departments that touch on high-level questions like what scientific questions are central to our study, and [what kinds of evidence are considered the most important]({%post_url 2019-09-15-why-not-linear %}). I also co-organized a linguistics course for cognitive scientists and computer scientists at MIT in Fall 2019.
